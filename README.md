# Passport-Withings

[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/mko/passport-withings.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)

[Passport](https://github.com/jaredhanson/passport) strategy for authenticating
with [Withings](https://my.withings.com) using the OAuth 1.0a API.

## Installation

    $ npm install passport-withings

## Usage

#### Configure Strategy

The Withings authentication strategy authenticates users using a Withings account and
OAuth tokens.  The strategy requires a `verify` callback, which accepts these
credentials and calls `done` providing a user, as well as `options` specifying a
consumer key, consumer secret, and callback URL.

    passport.use(new WithingsStrategy({
        consumerKey: WITHINGS_CONSUMER_KEY,
        consumerSecret: WITHINGS_CONSUMER_SECRET,
        callbackURL: "http://127.0.0.1:3000/auth/withings/callback"
      },
      function(token, tokenSecret, profile, done) {
        User.findOrCreate({ withingsId: profile.id }, function (err, user) {
          return done(err, user);
        });
      }
    ));

#### Authenticate Requests

Use `passport.authenticate()`, specifying the `'withings'` strategy, to
authenticate requests.

For example, as route middleware in an [Express](http://expressjs.com/)
application:

    app.get('/auth/withings',
      passport.authenticate('withings'),
      function(req, res){
        // The request will be redirected to Withings for authentication, so this
        // function will not be called.
      });
    
    app.get('/auth/withings/callback', 
      passport.authenticate('withings', { failureRedirect: '/login' }),
      function(req, res) {
        // Successful authentication, redirect home.
        res.redirect('/');
      });
